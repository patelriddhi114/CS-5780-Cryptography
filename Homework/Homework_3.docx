1. SET.  Suppose PI = 78, OI =95. The hash function is h(x) = (x+13) mod 291. The customer's key pair is: 

public key{17, 377},  private key{257, 377}.  Concatenation works like this:  23||45 = 2345.  Assume that both the merchant and the bank know the public key of the customer. The signature algorithm is RSA.

1) What's the dual signature created by the customer? Describe in detail how the customer create it.

2) What information does the merchant need to know to verify the dual signature and how to verify it?

3) What information does the bank need to know to verify the dual signature and how to verify it?

2. (AONDS) Alice has the following 4 12-bit secrets for sale:
            S1=1191, S2=1572, S3=2461 S4=1568
    Bob wants to buy S1 and Carol wants to buy S2.

The key pair for Bob is n=7387, e=5145, d=777. The key pair for Carol is n=2747,e=1421,d=2261. She tells Bob and Carol each their public key

Please describe step by step how Bob and Carol buy the secrets they want without letting Alice know which secrets they are buying.

 

3.(Shamir's secret sharing) Construct (3,4) threshold scheme to share a secret S = 18.

a) Create a secure polynomial.

b) Assign each participant a share.

c) Show how any 3 of the participant pool their shares to recover the secret S.

(Note: It's up to you to decide the values involved in the computation)

4. (Generalized secret sharing).  Suppose there are 5 participants {P1, P2,P3,P4,P5} and the access structure AS is { {P1, P2, P5}, {P2, P4}, {P3,P5} }.  Use Shamir's scheme to assign each participant share(s) so that only authorized group of participants can recover the secret.

(Note: you don't need to assign each participant specific values. Use s1, s2,... to denote the shares)

5. (Verifiable secret sharing). Construct a (3,3) verifiable threshold scheme to share a secret S=24.

a) How does the dealer construct a secure polynomial?

b) Assign each participant a share.

c) What information does the dealer publish?

d) How does each participant verify the validity of his/her share?

(Note: It's up to you to decide the values involved in the computation. Suppose p is large enough. You don't need a specific value for g)

6. (Proxy signature) In MUO's proxy signature scheme, p=239 and  g=7. The original signer's private key x=17.

a) Generate a proxy key pair.

b) How does the proxy signer verify the validity of the proxy key pair?

c) The proxy signer needs to sign a message m=16 on behalf of the original signer. How does (S)he generate the proxy signature?

d) How does a verifier verify the proxy signature?

7. (Partially Blind signature) The signer's public key pair is (11,91) and he keeps (d,p,q)=(59, 7, 13) secure. A requester want the signer to sign m=19 with h(m)=18. The common information a is 25 with h(a) = 17.

a) How does the requester blind m and what information does he send to the signer?

b) After the signer receives the information sent by the requester, he selects a random number x=29 and send x the the requester. After the requester receives x, what does he do and what information does he send to the signer?

c) How does the signer generate a blind signature?

d) After the requester gets the blind signature, how does he extract the signature?

e) How to verify the extracted signature?
